# Floor Finishes by Room using Grasshopper Inside Revit

Hi,

This is BIMGEEK. In this video, we are going to automate floor finish creation using Grasshopper inside Revit. Creating floor finishes is a task that can be automated easily and save us a huge amount of time. When room finishes are defined or embedded in a room's parameter, it doesn't make any sense to model floor finishes manually. We are going to create floor finishes from room boundaries using Grasshopper inside Revit. Lets get started!

## Requirements

- **Rhinoceros 7**
- **Rhino Inside Revit** - to install Rhino inside Revit, head over to [Rhino.Inside website.](https://www.rhino3d.com/inside/revit/1.0/)
- **Autodesk Revit** - I am using Revit 2022 in this tutorial.

Creating floors with curveloops is a new feature that came with version 2022. So if you are using an older version, it will create a new floor for each loop.
