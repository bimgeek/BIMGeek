## Intro

Hi,

This is BIMGEEK. In this video, we are going to automate floor finish creation using Grasshopper inside Revit. Creating floor finishes is a task that can be automated easily and save us a huge amount of time. When room finishes are defined or embedded in a room's parameter, it doesn't make any sense to model floor finishes manually. We are going to create floor finishes from room boundaries using Grasshopper inside Revit. Lets get started!
