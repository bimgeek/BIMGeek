# BIMGeek

## Hey👋, I'm Mucahit Bilal, a Computational Design Technologist living in Turkey.

With background in architecture, I am passionate about computational design and BIM. Currently, I am working at **[Kalyon Co.](https://kalyonholding.com/Home)** as a Computational Design Specialist, working across multiple projects doing a lot of automation for tedious tasks. I am specialised in the use of BIM and its implementation in a wide variety of project scales and types. I have a high level of understanding in **Python🐍, Dynamo and Grasshopper🦗** and recently in **JavaScript✨**. 

I envision a connected, progressive and collaborative AEC Industry. I have a strong level of ability to organize activities, work with team members and increase the motivation of team. I am open to learn, extend, and improve the individual capabilities and communication skills. I love learning new things, tools and softwares in my spare time.

## What I'm focusing on 👨‍💻
I have improved my knowledge on **Revit API** with **Python** to some extent. Currently improving my **JavaScript** skills to get into **Forge**.
